# Introduction to Granite Code Models

We introduce the Granite series of decoder-only code models for code generative tasks (e.g., fixing bugs, explaining code, documenting code), trained with code written in 116 programming languages. A comprehensive evaluation of the Granite Code model family on diverse tasks demonstrates that our models consistently reach state-of-the-art performance among available open-source code LLMs. 

## The key advantages of Granite Code models include:

All-rounder Code LLM: Granite Code models achieve competitive or state-of-the-art performance on different kinds of code-related tasks, including code generation, explanation, fixing, editing, translation, and more. Demonstrating their ability to solve diverse coding tasks.
Trustworthy Enterprise-Grade LLM: All our models are trained on license-permissible data collected following IBM's AI Ethics principles and guided by IBMâ€™s Corporate Legal team for trustworthy enterprise usage. We release all our Granite Code models under an Apache 2.0 license license for research and commercial use.
