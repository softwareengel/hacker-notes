Reddit.com; The OSA has made it impossible to do my subreddit moderation work: I need to be able to review a user's profile if they submit a post/comments to any of the subreddits I moderate. Any profile marked as "18+", which DOES NOT imply pornographic content, is now blocked from view when accessing Reddit from the UK. I refuse outright to scan my face into a dodgy third-party site, so I HAVE to use a VPN to continue moderating my (medical professional) subreddits. It's insane.

Itch.io blocks certain pages due to the OSA. However, directly accessing the pages allows you to view content anyway. The content may or may not even be "adult". Example: Pages on itch are organised by domain with the name of an author. The main index at https://elajo.itch.io Gives a message about the OSA. But pages within can be accessed if you already know the exact path name.
