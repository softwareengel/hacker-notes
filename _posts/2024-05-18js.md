# JavaScript Questions

A long list of (advanced) JavaScript questions, and their explanations 

From basic to advanced: test how well you know JavaScript, refresh your knowledge a bit or prepare for your coding interview! 💪 🚀 I update this repo regularly with new questions. I added the answers in the **collapsed sections** below the questions, simply click on them to expand it. It's just for fun, good luck! ❤️
