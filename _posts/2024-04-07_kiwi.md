Kiwi is a WebSocket adapter for real-time data sources. It implements a simple protocol for clients to subscribe to configured sources, while allowing operators to maintain control over the flow of data via WebAssembly (WASM) plugins. Kiwi is designed to be a lightweight, extensible, and secure solution for delivering real-time data to clients, ensuring that they stay reactive and up-to-date with the latest data.
