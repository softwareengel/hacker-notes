# # BookML: automated LaTeX to [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/html.html#gitbook-style)-style HTML and SCORM, powered by [LaTeXML](https://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/)

BookML is a small wrapper around [LaTeXML](https://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/) for the production of accessible HTML content straight from LaTeX files, and for packaging it as SCORM. Created by and maintained for maths lecturers at the University of Leeds.
