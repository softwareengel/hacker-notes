# Jekyll Docker

Jekyll Docker is a software image that has Jekyll and many of its dependencies ready to use for you in an encapsulated format. It includes a default set of gems, different image types with different extra packages, and wrappers to make Jekyll run more smoothly from start to finish for most Jekyll users. If you would like to know more about Docker you can visit [https://docker.com](https://docker.com), and if you would like to know more about Jekyll, you can visit [https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
