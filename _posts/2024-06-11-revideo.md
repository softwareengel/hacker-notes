Revideo - Create Videos with Code
Revideo is an open source framework for programmatic video editing. It is forked from the amazing Motion Canvas editor, with the goal of turning it from a standalone application into a library that developers can use to build entire video editing apps.

Revideo lets you create video templates in Typescript and deploy an API endpoint to render them with dynamic inputs. It also provides a React player component to preview changes in the browser in real-time. If you want to learn more, you can check out our docs, our examples repository, and join our Discord server.
