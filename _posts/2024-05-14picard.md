Pi-card is an AI powered voice assistant running entirely on a Raspberry Pi. It is capable of doing anything a standard LLM (like ChatGPT) can do in a conversational setting. In addition, if there is a camera equipped, you can also ask Pi-card to take a photo, describe what it sees, and then ask questions about that image.
