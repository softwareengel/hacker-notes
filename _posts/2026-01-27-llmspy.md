# [Introducing llms.py 🚀](https://llmspy.org/docs/getting-started#introducing-llmspy-)

We're excited to announce **[llms.py](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms)** - a super lightweight CLI tool and OpenAI-compatible server that acts as a **configurable gateway** over multiple configurable Large Language Model (LLM) providers.

## [🎯 OpenRouter but Local](https://llmspy.org/docs/getting-started#-openrouter-but-local)

**llms.py** is designed as a **unified gateway** that seamlessly connects you to multiple LLM providers through a single, consistent interface. Whether using cloud APIs or local models, `llms` provides intelligent routing and automatic failover to ensure your AI workflows connect to your chosen providers in your preferred priority - whether optimizing for cost, performance, or availability.
