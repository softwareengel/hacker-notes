# NVIDIA DGX Spark: great hardware, early days for the ecosystem

NVIDIA sent me a preview unit of their new [DGX Spark](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/) desktop “AI supercomputer”. I’ve never had hardware to review before! You can consider this my first ever sponsored post if you like, but they did not pay me any cash and aside from an embargo date they did not request (nor would I grant) any editorial input into what I write about the device.

The device retails for around $4,000. They officially go on sale tomorrow.

First impressions are that this is a snazzy little computer. It’s similar in size to a Mac mini, but with an exciting textured surface that feels refreshingly different and a little bit [science fiction](https://www.indiewire.com/awards/industry/devs-cinematography-rob-hardy-alex-garland-1234583396/).
