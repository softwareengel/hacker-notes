# Data Engineering for Large Models: Architecture, Algorithms & Projects

## Introduction

[](https://github.com/datascale-ai/data_engineering_book/blob/main/README_en.md#introduction)

> _"Data is the new oil, but only if you know how to refine it."_

In the era of large models, **data quality determines the upper bound of model performance**. Yet systematic resources on LLM data engineering remain extremely scarce — most teams are still learning by trial and error.

This book is designed to fill that gap. We systematically cover the complete technical stack from **pre-training data cleaning** to **multimodal alignment**, from **RAG retrieval augmentation** to **synthetic data generation**, including:

- 🧹 **Pre-training Data Engineering**: Extracting high-quality corpora from massive noisy data sources like Common Crawl
- 🖼️ **Multimodal Data Processing**: Collection, cleaning, and alignment of image-text pairs, video, and audio data
- 🎯 **Alignment Data Construction**: Automated generation of SFT instruction data, RLHF preference data, and CoT reasoning data
- 🔍 **RAG Data Pipeline**: Enterprise-grade document parsing, semantic chunking, and multimodal retrieval

Beyond in-depth theoretical explanations, the book includes **5 end-to-end capstone projects** with runnable code and detailed architecture designs for hands-on learning.
