# ðŸš€ RAG on Windows using TensorRT-LLM, NVIDIA NIM and LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™

ChatRTX is a demo app that lets you personalize a GPT large language model (LLM) connected to your own contentâ€”docs, notes, photos. Leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/), [NVIDIA NIM microservices](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/index.html) and RTX acceleration, you can query a custom chatbot to quickly get contextually relevant answers. This app also lets you give query through your voice. As it all runs locally on your Windows RTX PC, youâ€™ll get fast and secure results. ChatRTX supports various file formats, including text, pdf, doc/docx, xml, png, jpg, bmp. Simply point the application at the folder containing your files and it'll load them into the library in a matter of seconds.
