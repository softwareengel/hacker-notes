# # **Hacking With PDF**

use PDF as an attack vector, I went through multiple resources that gave me a lot of valuable information, but without knowledge of the PDF structure will face a lot of difficulties, I decided to dig more and learn the structure of PDF, This inspired me how we can use PDF as an attack vector and perform multiple attacks with huge subsequences to the victim.
