Sail is a language for defining the instruction-set architecture (ISA) semantics of processors: the architectural specification of the behaviour of machine instructions. Sail is an engineer-friendly language, much like earlier vendor pseudocode, but more precisely defined and with tooling to support a wide range of use-cases.
