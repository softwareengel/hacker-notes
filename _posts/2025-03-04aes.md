This page is here to teach you about block cipher cryptanalysis. It does not pretend to be an exhaustive list of attacks, but will give you enough to get started.

The course is split in several sets, the first being on AES. We could have made up a simple block cipher, but it's more fun to attack the real thing don't you think?
