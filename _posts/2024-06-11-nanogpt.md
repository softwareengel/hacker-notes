Spreadsheet Is All You Need (Excel version added!)
A nanoGPT pipeline packed in a spreadsheet

This is a project that I did to help myself understand how GPT works.
It is pretty fun to play with, especially when you are trying to figure out what exactly is going on inside a transformer.
This helped me to visualize the entire structure and the data flow.
All the mechanisms, calculations, matrices inside are fully interactive and configurable.
