# Magicoder.. Source Code Is All You Need


- ðŸŽ©**Magicoder** is a model family empowered by **OSS-Instruct**, a novel approach to enlightening LLMs with open-source code snippets for generating _low-bias_ and _high-quality_ instruction data for code.
- **OSS-Instruct** mitigates the _inherent bias_ of the LLM-synthesized instruction data by empowering them with _a wealth of open-source references_ to produce more diverse, realistic, and controllable data.
