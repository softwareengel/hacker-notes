![](../_asset/2023-09-18-18-54-07_webvm_image_1.jpg)

_TLDR: WebVM is a Linux-like virtual machine running fully client-side in the browser. It is based on CheerpX: a x86 execution engine in WebAssembly by Leaning Technologies. With today’s update, you can deploy your own version of WebVM by simply_ [_forking the repo_![](https://labs.leaningtech.com/icons/external-link.svg)](https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm) _on GitHub and editing the included Dockerfile. A GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy it to GitHub pages._
