# A modest JavaScript framework for the HTML you already have


Stimulus is a JavaScript framework with modest ambitions. It doesn't seek to take over your entire front-endâ€”in fact, it's not concerned with rendering HTML at all. Instead, it's designed to augment your HTML with just enough behavior to make it shine. Stimulus pairs beautifully with [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev) to provide a complete solution for fast, compelling applications with a minimal amount of effort.
