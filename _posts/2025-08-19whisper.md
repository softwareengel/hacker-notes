Whispering is an open-source speech-to-text application. Press a keyboard shortcut, speak, and your words will transcribe, transform, then copy and paste at the cursor.

I really like hands-free voice dictation. For years, I relied on transcription tools that were almost good, but they were all closed-source. Even those claiming to be “local” or “on-device” were still black boxes that left me wondering where my audio really went.

So I built Whispering. It’s open-source, local-first, and most importantly, transparent with your data. ​​Your data is stored locally on your device, and your audio goes directly from your machine to a local provider (Speaches, owhisper, etc.) or your chosen cloud provider (Groq, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, etc.) without any middleman or vendor lock-in. For me, the features were good enough that I left my paid tools behind (I used Superwhisper and Wispr Flow before).

Productivity apps should be open-source and transparent with your data, but they also need to match the UX of paid, closed-software alternatives. I hope Whispering is near that point. I use it for several hours a day, from coding to thinking out loud while carrying pizza boxes back from the office
