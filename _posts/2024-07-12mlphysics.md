Welcome to the Physics-based Deep Learning Book (v0.2) ðŸ‘‹

TL;DR: This document contains a practical and comprehensive introduction of everything related to deep learning in the context of physical simulations. As much as possible, all topics come with hands-on code examples in the form of Jupyter notebooks to quickly get started. Beyond standard supervised learning from data, weâ€™ll look at physical loss constraints, more tightly coupled learning algorithms with differentiable simulations, training algorithms tailored to physics problems, as well as reinforcement learning and uncertainty modeling. We live in exciting times: these methods have a huge potential to fundamentally change what computer simulations can achieve.
