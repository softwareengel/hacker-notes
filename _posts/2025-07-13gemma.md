The first Gemma model launched early last year and has since grown into a thriving Gemmaverse of over 160 million collective downloads. This ecosystem includes our family of over a dozen specialized models for everything from safeguarding to medical applications and, most inspiringly, the countless innovations from the community. From innovators like Roboflow building enterprise computer vision to the Institute of Science Tokyo creating highly-capable Japanese Gemma variants, your work has shown us the path forward.

Building on this incredible momentum, we're excited to announce the full release of Gemma 3n. While last month's preview offered a glimpse, today unlocks the full power of this mobile-first architecture. Gemma 3n is designed for the developer community that helped shape Gemma. Itâ€™s supported by your favorite tools including Hugging Face Transformers, llama.cpp, Google AI Edge, Ollama, MLX, and many others, enabling you to fine-tune and deploy for your specific on-device applications with ease. This post is the developer deep dive: we'll explore some of the innovations behind Gemma 3n, share new benchmark results, and show you how to start building today.
