# Advanced Python Mastery (course by @dabeaz)
An exercise-driven course on Advanced Python Programming that was battle-tested several hundred times on the corporate-training circuit for more than a decade. Written by David Beazley, author of the [Python Cookbook, 3rd Edition](https://www.dabeaz.com/cookbook.html) (O'Reilly) and [Python Distilled](https://www.dabeaz.com/python-distilled/index.html) (Addison-Wesley). Released under a Creative Commons license. Free of ads, tracking, pop-ups, newsletters, and AI.

Everything in this course should work with the latest version of Python, but be aware that the course primarily targets the feature set of Python 3.6. As such, certain modern features don't get coverage. Honestly, this shouldn't affect you much unless you're trying to write code that's freakishly clever.
