FastUI is a new way to build web application user interfaces defined by declarative Python code.

This means:

- **If you're a Python developer** — you can build responsive web applications using React without writing a single line of JavaScript, or touching `npm`.
- **If you're a frontend developer** — you can concentrate on building magical components that are truly reusable, no copy-pasting components for each view.
- **For everyone** — a true separation of concerns, the backend defines the entire application; while the frontend is free to implement just the user interface

At its heart, FastUI is a set of matching [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev) models and TypeScript interfaces that allow you to define a user interface. This interface is validated at build time by TypeScript and pyright/mypy and at runtime by Pydantic.
